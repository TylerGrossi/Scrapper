# Earnings Momentum Strategy

A quantitative trading strategy that identifies stocks with positive technical momentum ahead of earnings announcements.

## Strategy Overview

### Entry Criteria (All must be met)

1. **Earnings This Week** - Stock has earnings announcement scheduled for the current week
2. **SMA20 > SMA50** - 20-day simple moving average has crossed above the 50-day SMA (golden cross)
3. **Barchart Buy Signal** - Stock shows a "Buy" opinion signal on Barchart.com

### Entry Timing

* **BMO (Before Market Open)** : Buy at previous day's close (~4pm day before earnings)
* **AMC (After Market Close)** : Buy at earnings day close (~4pm on earnings day)

### Exit Rules

1. **Stop Loss: -10%** - Exit if position drops 10% from entry price
   * If stock gaps down and opens below -10%, take the actual gap loss (not -10%)
2. **Time Exit: Day 5** - Exit at market close on trading day 5 if stop loss not triggered
3. **No Profit Cap** - Let winners run; do not cap upside

## Data Filtering Logic

The app applies consistent filtering across all tabs:

1. **Remove DATE PASSED** - Tickers where `Date Check = 'DATE PASSED'` are excluded
2. **Require 5D Return** - Only tickers with valid 5D Return data are included in analysis

**Exception:** The "This Week's Reported Earnings" table in Stock Screener uses **unfiltered data** to show recent earnings even before 5D returns are available.

---

## Streamlit App Features

### Stock Screener Tab

* **This Week's Reported Earnings** - Shows tickers from returns_tracker with earnings in current week (Sun-Sat)
* **Live Stock Scanner** - Scans Finviz/Barchart for new opportunities
  * Skips tickers with DATE PASSED
  * Skips tickers where earnings passed but weren't in tracker (missed opportunities)

### PowerBI Tab

* Embedded PowerBI dashboard for visual analysis

### Stop Loss Analysis Tab

* Backtest with configurable stop loss levels
* Compare strategy vs buy & hold
* Exit breakdown (Gap Down, Stop Loss, Held to Day 5)
* Stop loss level comparison tool

### Earnings Analysis Tab

* Beat vs Miss performance analysis
* EPS Surprise magnitude correlation
* Raw data explorer

---

## Important Notes

### Gap Down Handling

If a stock gaps down and the first candle opens below the stop loss level:

* You take the  **actual gap loss** , not the stop loss price
* Example: Stop is -10%, stock opens at -15% → You lose 15%, not 10%
* This reflects real trading where you cannot exit at a price that was never traded

### Date Validation

The model validates earnings dates by comparing Finviz dates with yfinance:

* `DATE PASSED` = Finviz shows future date but earnings already happened
* These tickers are filtered out of backtests

### Earnings Week Definition

* Week runs **Sunday to Saturday**
* Example: If today is Tuesday Jan 14, the week is Jan 12 (Sun) - Jan 18 (Sat)

### Data Limitations

* Hourly data from yfinance only available for last ~730 days
* Some tickers may not have complete hourly data

---

## Strategy Rationale

1. **Momentum** - SMA20 > SMA50 indicates positive price momentum
2. **Catalyst** - Earnings announcement provides potential for gap up
3. **Confirmation** - Barchart buy signal adds technical confirmation
4. **Risk Management** - 10% stop loss limits downside while allowing upside
5. **Time Decay** - Exit by Day 5 captures post-earnings momentum before mean reversion
